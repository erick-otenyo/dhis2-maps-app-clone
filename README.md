# dhis2-maps-app-clone
A generic web mapping tool inspired by dhis2-maps-app

# Idea

I have been playing with the [DHIS2 Maps app](https://github.com/dhis2/maps-app) for sometime and I liked the way it is implemented.
It has a clean UI as you can see from the screenshot below.

The maps app is intergrated with DHIS2 as a DHIS2 app, and thus it can not work outside the DHIS2. I wanted to have it run as a standalone
web mapping applicationg, which you can just install, set a few configurations and it runs generically, outside of DHIS2.

I peeked into the (code)[https://github.com/dhis2/maps-app] and decided to build a generic app out of it. This repo is the product and I am
actively working on it
